            <p>The project was done as part of the UX design training at Career Foundry which followed a fixed course plan.
              It was executed in a span of 6 months.
            </p>
            <p>It includes designing a web app. The project also includes coming up with the concept, app name
              and logo, problem statement, competitive research, user flows, creating
              low to high definition prototypes and user testing iterations.
            </p>
            <p> Working on this project helped me deepen my knowledge in the various techniques used during UX designing and
              also impress the power of UX to influence and help users to have a wonderful experience while doing their activities.

            gives them the confidence to share problems with a stranger. As a rapport is built, they can switch to voice call.<p></p>

                <h4>Feedback</h4>
                Errors and negative observations were rated from critical to minor using affinity maps. Critical and major errors were fixed, while
                some observations were noted but no action was taken at this stage. A negative observation raised was found to be due to lack of clear
                instructions for the task and the test script was updated accordingly for future test cycles.

              its a very valid observation that can prove critical to the app usage. The time elements are now bigger and the calendar can be scrolled down to reveal the
              remaining time slots.

      <h2>WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Baby Steps</h4>
              To remember to breakdown activities to smaller manageable tasks. This helps me focus and plan better.
              <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Fast Decisions</h4>
              Using techniques like crazy 8 to visualize various possibilities. Employing these techniques not just
              for prototyping but also in other design areas helps to reduce time taken in contemplating over decisions.
              <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Documentation</h4>
              I realized that a rough draft of the design language documentation should be made available as early as
              possible in the project life cycle of prototyping, testing and refining. This would help set standards as
              soon as the high level wireframe are made and reduce a lot of rework. In this project I had a lot of different
              font families and sizes across the screen which had to be revisited.
              <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Participant Awareness</h4>
              The test participants of this project were not very aware of the aim of usability testing. This caused many
              participants to be distracted by the non-Functioning components of the prototype. I would create and share a
              short video clip explaining the expectations from this test using a different example. This would be useful
              especially in case of remote testing.
              <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Reviews</h4>
              Peer reviews are very important as they bring out totally different perspective to your designs.
              <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Teamwork</h4>
              Collaboration is the keyword to a successful project. It is important to document and collate all
              information required ready to be handed over to the engineering team. These documents need to be updated on a regular basis
              <p></p>
