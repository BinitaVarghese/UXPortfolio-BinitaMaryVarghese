            <p>The project was done as part of the UX design training at Career Foundry It was my first experience with UX
              designing and was executed in 4 weeks.
            </p>
            <p>The project included designing a low fidelity wireframe and prototype for a native app for German vocabulary
              learning for busy individuals. The project also included coming up with the concept, conducting competitive
              market research, developing a user persona and the problem statement and user testing
            </p>
            <p> The project introduced me to various techniques that are used during UX designing especially the crazy 8
              technique which I find is very useful for taking quick decisions while ensuring that you have looked at alternatives.

            <p>For this project I decided that my focus group would be the expat community who have had some experience using vocab or
              language apps when they first moved to Germany in the age range of 30 - 50. I used social media to contact people in the
              vicinity and the interviews were done using video calls.</p>

          <h3>A FEW LESSONS FROM THIS PROJECT​​​​​​​​​​​​​​...</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><span class="highlight">Time Management </span> is a very important aspect to take in consideration during user interviews for
                survey as well as usability testing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>I also realised that people may not be available at the appointed time for various reasons, so I would have to account
                for <span class="highlight">cancellations </span>and plan for more interviews than less. This would ensure I have <span class="highlight"> enough inputs </span>
                for the phase.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span class="highlight">Setting expectations </span> for usability test is also an area that I would focus on. Test participants need to be made aware
                of expectations before the actual test if need be, so that they focus only on test situations rather than the look during
                the prototype phase. A detailed test script would also have helped me during the test phase.
